                    <p>
                            I currently work as a Business Analyst on the Information Systems team at an 
                            investment consulting firm in Portsmouth, NH. My job is focused on reviewing, defining, documenting, 
                            and implementing technology initiatives related to internal business processes. I 
                            manage and maintain our primary platform that facilitates the company's workflows and 
                            data storage. I am also responsible for developing and implementing new business 
                            procedures to improve operational efficiency. I honestly love my job and am super lucky
                            to work with a brilliant team. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prior to my current job I worked as a Performance Analyst at the same firm. During this
                            time I oversaw reporting for monthly investment valuations, fund performance, asset allocation 
                            targets, segment benchmarks, transactions, and portfolio characteristics for approximately
                            800 investments across 20 clients. I also had a client service/adminitrative position before I 
                            transitioned to my later analyst roles. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I grew up in Dover, NH and went to UNH for college. I double majored in Economics and International Affiars, 
                            with a minor in Spanish. I studied abroad in Chile my junior year and wrote my senior capstone research paper 
                            on how microenterprises and the government programs that support them have contributed to Chile's economic development. 
                            Economics is a fascinating subject and I'm particularly interested in emerging markets (especially Latin America).

                            Right now I live in Newmarket, NH with my boyfriend Steve and my dog Logan. We are both UNH
                            graduates who moved back to the area this past September after living in Ipswich, MA for the past
                            couple years. We spend our time visiting nearby towns (especially the restaurants), exploring all the natural beauty 
                            with our dog, going to farms, and playing video games. Life is good!
